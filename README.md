# Customer Churn Prediction and Streamlit App

This repository contains code for preprocessing customer churn data and creating a Streamlit web application for interactive predictions. The data preprocessing code prepares the dataset for machine learning, while the Streamlit app allows users to make predictions based on the trained model.

## Data Preprocessing

### Prerequisites

Before running the preprocessing code, ensure you have the following libraries installed:

- pandas
- scikit-learn
- joblib

You can install these libraries using `pip`:

```bash
pip install pandas scikit-learn joblib
